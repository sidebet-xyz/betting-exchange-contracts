# Side‚Çøet: Decentralized Betting Exchange Contracts for RSK & EVM compatible chains

Welcome to the `Side‚Çøet` repository! Here, we host the Solidity smart contracts designed for the decentralized betting exchange platform, primarily for the RSK (Rootstock) network, an EVM-compatible chain. Side‚Çøet enables users to place, accept, and settle bets using the native Side‚Çøet Token. Additionally, a dedicated faucet contract facilitates the distribution of tokens for testing or promotional campaigns.

## BettingExchangeToken.sol

The `BettingExchangeToken` Solidity contract is the heart of the Side‚Çøet platform on the RSK network. This contract allows users to seamlessly place, accept, and settle bets. Here's a comprehensive look:

1. **Prerequisites and Libraries**:
    - The contract uses Solidity version `^0.8.9`.
    - The contract imports OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` standard to represent the betting exchange token, ensuring standardized functionalities like transfer and balanceOf.
    - The contract also imports OpenZeppelin's `Counters` library for safely incrementing and decrementing values.

2. **State Variables**:
    - `betsIds`: A counter for unique bet IDs.
    - `refereeOracle`: The default oracle responsible for settling bets.
    - `emergencyOracle`: An oracle that can change the oracle address for any bet in emergency situations.
    - `owner`: The address of the owner, typically the deployer.
    - `idToBet`: Mapping from a bet ID to the corresponding `Bet` struct.
    - `settledBets`: Mapping to keep track of bets that have been settled.
    - `canceledBets`: Mapping to keep track of bets that have been canceled.

3. **Structs**:
    - `Bet`: Represents a single bet with details like creator (Alice), acceptor (Bob), bet amount, activity status, listing status, cancellation status, and the responsible oracle.

4. **Events**:
    - `BetCreated`: Emitted when a new bet is created.
    - `BetAccepted`: Emitted when a bet is accepted by Bob.
    - `BetSettled`: Emitted when a bet is settled by an oracle.
    - `BetOracleUpdated`: Emitted when the oracle of a bet is changed.
    - `BetCanceled`: Emitted when a bet is canceled by its creator.

5. **Modifiers**:
    - `onlyOwner`: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute a function.

6. **Constructor**:
    - The constructor initializes the betting token and sets the default and emergency oracles. It also mints an initial supply of tokens to the contract deployer.

7. **Functions**:
    - `setRefereeOracle`: Allows the owner to set or update the default oracle.
    - `createBet`: Users can create a new bet specifying the amount and the oracle. If no oracle is specified, the default oracle is used.
    - `readBet`: Returns the details of a specific bet.
    - `updateBetOracle`: Allows changing the oracle for a specific bet. This can be done by the bet's creator (before the bet is accepted) or the emergency oracle.
    - `acceptBet`: Allows a user to accept an existing bet.
    - `settleBet`: Allows the oracle to settle a bet, declaring either Alice or Bob as the winner.
    - `cancelBet`: Allows the creator of the bet to cancel it if it hasn't been accepted yet.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Access Control**:
    - Consider adding more roles (e.g., admins) or implementing role-based access control (RBAC). OpenZeppelin provides a handy `AccessControl` contract for this.

2. **Emergency Stop**:
    - Implement a "circuit breaker" pattern or "pause" functionality to halt the contract operations in emergencies.

3. **Further Functionality**:
    - Consider adding functionality for disputes, where, if either party is unhappy with the oracle's decision, there's a mechanism to challenge it.

4. **Gas Optimization**:
    - Constantly reviewing and refactoring the contract can lead to gas optimizations.

5. **Audit**:
    - Before deploying any contract to the mainnet, especially those handling user funds, ensure that it undergoes a thorough professional audit.

6. **Comments**:
    - The code is well-commented and organized, making it readable and understandable. It's always a good practice to keep the comments updated if there are future changes to the codebase.

All in all, this contract provides a sturdy backbone for a betting exchange platform on RSK and other EVM-compatible chains, leveraging the ERC20 token standard.

## BettingExchangeTokenFaucet.sol

In the Side‚Çøet ecosystem on RSK, the `BettingExchangeTokenFaucet` assumes a crucial role. This Solidity contract aims to distribute the `BettingExchangeToken` either freely for testing purposes or as a part of initial promotions. Let's delve deeper:

### 1. **Prerequisites and Libraries**:

   - **Solidity Version**: The contract uses the Solidity version `^0.8.9`.
   
   - **Dependencies**: The contract imports the `BettingExchangeToken.sol` to interact with the token itself.

### 2. **State Variables**:

   - `token`: A reference to the associated `BettingExchangeToken` contract.
   
   - `maxTokensPerRequest`: Specifies the maximum number of tokens a user can request in one go.
   
   - `hasRequested`: A mapping to keep track of addresses that have already received tokens from the faucet.
   
   - `owner`: The address of the owner of this faucet, typically the one who deploys the contract.

### 3. **Constructor**:

   - The constructor is designed to set the address of the `BettingExchangeToken`, the maximum tokens that users can request per call, and the decimal precision of the tokens.

### 4. **Functions**:

   - `requestTokens`: Allows users to request a specific number of tokens from the faucet. Users can only request tokens once and only if they haven't received tokens before and have a balance of zero in the associated token.
   
   - `getFaucetBalance`: Returns the current balance of tokens held by the faucet.
   
   - `replenishFaucet`: Allows the owner to add more tokens to the faucet. This is done by transferring tokens from the owner's address to the faucet.

### 5. **Modifiers**:
   
   - `onlyOwner`: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute specific functions, such as replenishing the faucet.

### 6. **Recommendations and Next Steps**:

   - **Rate-Limiting**: To prevent abuse, consider adding functionality to rate-limit the number of requests an address can make in a specific time frame.
   
   - **Emergency Shutdown**: Implement a "pause" functionality to halt the faucet's operations in emergencies.
   
   - **Whitelisting**: Consider adding a whitelist mechanism where only whitelisted addresses can request tokens. This can be helpful in private testnets or specific promotional campaigns.
   
   - **Audit**: As always, before deploying on the mainnet, especially if it holds a significant number of tokens, it's crucial to get the contract professionally audited.

   - **Comments and Documentation**: The current codebase is well-documented, ensuring clarity in understanding functionalities. It's good practice to maintain this level of documentation as the code evolves.

### 7. **Conclusion**:
The `BettingExchangeTokenFaucet` is a utility contract designed to distribute tokens to users in a controlled manner. Its simple structure ensures easy deployment and interaction, making it a great tool for promotional and testing purposes.

In essence, the `BettingExchangeTokenFaucet` is a pivotal utility contract in the Side‚Çøet architecture, ensuring controlled token distribution for both promotional initiatives and rigorous testing on RSK.
